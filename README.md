Anime: Plan To Watch List
========================
Made to go through your Plan to Watch list at Myanimelist.net and add ratings to all the titles, since you would have to manually click each individual page to see the rating instead of having the rating readily available.

This program currently no longer works, put up for proof of concept. It did originally work, but they have since changed their html, they have added a noindex and nofollow, and threw everything inside of an iframe that they didn't want indexed, so at this point the project is moot other than for referance and proof of concept.
<br /><br />
Uses HTMLParsers and multiple threads and Java frames. Was a fun day to make it was done about a year ago when a friend requested the application. There will need to be some changes to the code to accomodate the most recent html code on myanimelist.net, which I may do in the near future.

Seems that myanimelist has started a no crawling policy and puts everything in an iFrame so this is just a proof of concept now unfortunately.
